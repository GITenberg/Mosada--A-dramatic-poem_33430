<h3><span class="smcap">Scene I</span>.</h3>

<p class='center'>
<i>A Little Moorish Room in the Village of Azubia.<br />
In the centre of the room a chafing dish.</i></p>

<p><i>Mosada.</i> [<i>alone</i>] Three times the roses have grown less and less,<br />
As slowly Autumn climbed the golden throne<br />
Where sat old Summer fading into song,<br />
And thrice the peaches flushed upon the walls,<br />
And thrice the corn around the sickles flamed,<br />
Since 'mong my people, tented on the hills,<br />
He stood a messenger. In April's prime<br />
(Swallows were flashing their white breasts above<br />
Or perching on the tents, a-weary still<br />
From waste seas cross'd, yet ever garrulous)<br />
Along the velvet vale I saw him come:<br />
In Autumn, when far down the mountain slopes<br />
The heavy clusters of the grapes were full,<br />
I saw him sigh and turn and pass away;<br />
For I and all my people were accurst<br />
Of his sad God; and down among the grass<br />
Hiding my face, I cried long, bitterly.<br />
Twas evening, and the cricket nation sang<br />
Around my head and danced among the grass;<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>And all was dimness till a dying leaf<br />
Slid circling down and softly touched my lips<br />
With dew as though 'twere sealing them for death.<br />
Yet somewhere in the footsore world we meet<br />
We two before we die, for Azolar<br />
The star-taught Moor said thus it was decreed<br />
By those wan stars that sit in company<br />
Above the Alpujarras on their thrones,<br />
That when the stars of our nativity<br />
Draw star to star, as on that eve he passed<br />
Down the long valleys from my people's tents,<br />
We meet&mdash;we two.</p>

<p class='center'>[<i>She opens the casement&mdash;the mingled sound of the voices and<br />
laughter of the apple gatherers floats in.</i>]</p>

<p><span style="margin-left: 6em;">How merry all these are</span><br />
Among the fruit. But yon, lame Cola crouches<br />
Away from all the others. Now the sun&mdash;<br />
A-shining on the little crucifix<br />
Of silver hanging round lame Cola's neck&mdash;<br />
Sinks down at last with yonder minaret<br />
Of the Alhambra black athwart his disk;<br />
And Cola seeing, knows the sign and comes.<br />
Thus do I burn these precious herbs whose smoke<br />
Pours up and floats in fragrance o'er my head<br />
In coil on coil of azure.</p>

<p>[<i>Enter Cola.</i>] All is ready.</p>

<p><i>Cola.</i> Mosada, it is then so much the worse.<br />
I will not share your sin.</p>

<p><i>Mosada.</i><span style="margin-left: 8em;">It is no sin</span><br />
That you shall see on yonder glowing cloud<br />
Pictured, where wander the beloved feet<br />
Whose footfall I have longed for, three sad summers&mdash;<br />
Why these new fears?</p>

<p><i>Cola.</i><span style="margin-left: 6em;">The servant of the Lord,</span><br />
The dark still man, has come, and says 'tis sin.</p>

<p><i>Mosada.</i> They say the wish itself is half the sin.<br />
Then has this one been sinned full many times,<br />
Yet 'tis no sin&mdash;my father taught it me.<br />
He was a man most learned and most mild,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>Who, dreaming to a wondrous age, lived on<br />
Tending the roses round his lattice door.<br />
For years his days had dawned and faded thus<br />
Among the plants; the flowery silence fell<br />
Deep in his soul, like rain upon a soil<br />
Worn by the solstice fierce, and made it pure.<br />
Would he teach any sin?</p>

<p><i>Cola.</i><span style="margin-left: 10em;">Gaze in the cloud</span><br />
Yourself.</p>

<p><i>Mosada.</i> None but the innocent can see.</p>

<p><i>Cola.</i> They say I am all ugliness; lame-footed<br />
I am; one shoulder turned awry&mdash;why then<br />
Should I be good? But you are beautiful.</p>

<p><i>Mosada.</i> I cannot see.</p>

<p><i>Cola.</i><span style="margin-left: 6em;">The beetles, and the bats,</span><br />
And spiders, are my friends, I'm theirs, and they are<br />
Not good; but you are like the butterflies.</p>

<p><i>Mosada.</i> I cannot see! I cannot see! but you<br />
Shall see a thing to talk on when you're old,<br />
Under a lemon tree beside your door;<br />
And all the elders sitting in the sun,<br />
Will wondering listen, and this tale shall ease<br />
For long, the burthen of their talking griefs.</p>

<p><i>Cola.</i> Upon my knees I pray you, let it sleep,<br />
The vision.</p>

<p><i>Mosada.</i> You're pale and weeping, child.<br />
Be not afraid, you'll see no fearful thing.<br />
Thus, thus I beckon from her viewless fields&mdash;<br />
Thus beckon to our aid a Phantom fair<br />
And calm, robed all in raiment moony white.<br />
She was a great enchantress once of yore,<br />
Whose dwelling was a tree-wrapt island, lulled<br />
Far out upon the water world and ringed<br />
With wonderful white sand, where never yet<br />
Were furled the wings of ships. There in a dell<br />
A lily blanch&egrave;d place, she sat and sang,<br />
And in her singing wove around her head<br />
White lilies, and her song flew forth afar<br />
Along the sea; and many a man grew hushed<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>In his own house or 'mong the merchants grey,<br />
Hearing the far off singing guile and groaned,<br />
And manned an argosy and sailing died.<br />
In the far isle she sang herself asleep<br />
At last. But now I wave her to my side.</p>

<p><i>Cola.</i> Stay, stay, or I will hold your white arms down.<br />
Ah me, I cannot reach them&mdash;here and there<br />
Darting you wave them, darting in the vapour.<br />
Heard you? Your lute upon the wall has sounded!<br />
I feel a finger drawn across my cheek!</p>

<p><i>Mosada.</i> The phantoms come; ha ha! they come, they come!<br />
I wave them hither, my breast heaves with joy.<br />
Ah! now I'm eastern-hearted once again,<br />
And while they gather round my beckoning arms,<br />
I'll sing the songs the dusky lovers sing,<br />
Wandering in sultry palaces of Ind,<br />
A lotus in their hands&mdash;</p>

<p class='center'>[<i>The door is flung open. Enter the Officers of the Inquisition.</i>]</p>

<p><i>First Inquisitor.</i><span style="margin-left: 4em;">Young Moorish girl</span><br />
Taken in magic. In the Church's name<br />
I here arrest thee.</p>

<p><i>Mosada.</i><span style="margin-left: 6em;">It is Allah's will.</span><br />
Touch not this boy, for he is innocent.</p>

<p><i>Cola.</i> Forgive! for I have told them everything.<br />
They said I'd burn in hell unless I told<br />
Them all, and let them find you in the vapour.</p>

<p class='center'>[<i>She turns away&mdash;he clings to her dress.</i>]</p>

<p class='noindent'>Forgive me!</p>

<p><i>Mosada.</i><span style="margin-left: 6em;">It was Allah's will.</span></p>

<p><i>Second Inquisitor.</i><span style="margin-left: 8em;">Now cords.</span></p>

<p><i>Mosada.</i> No need to bind my hands. Where are ye, sirs,<br />
For ye are hid with vapours?</p>

<p><i>Second Inquisitor.</i><span style="margin-left: 6em;">Round the stake</span><br />
The vapour is much thicker.</p>

<p><i>Cola.</i><span style="margin-left: 8em;">God! the stake!</span><br />
Ye said that ye would fright her from her sin&mdash;<br />
No more; take me instead of her, great sirs.<br />
She was my only friend; I'm lame you know&mdash;<br />
One shoulder twisted, and the children cry<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>Names after me.</p>

<p><i>First Inquisitor.</i> Lady&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Mosada.</i><span style="margin-left: 6em;">I come.</span></p>

<p><i>Cola</i> [<i>following.</i>]<span style="margin-left: 8em;">Forgive.</span><br />
Forgive, or I will die.</p>

<p><i>First Inquisitor.</i><span style="margin-left: 6em;">Hush, hush!</span><br />
So she must burn you say.</p>

<p><i>Second Inquisitor.</i><span style="margin-left: 4em;">She must in truth.</span></p>

<p><i>First Inquisitor.</i> Will he not spare her life? How would one matter<br />
When there are many?</p>

<p><i>Second Monk.</i><span style="margin-left: 4em;">Ebremar will stamp</span><br />
This heathen horde away. You need not hope;<br />
And know you not she kissed that pious child<br />
With poisonous lips, and he is pining since?</p>

<p><i>First Monk.</i> You're full of wordiness. Come, hear my song.</p>

<p><i>Second Monk.</i> In truth an evil race; why strive for her,<br />
A little Moorish girl?</p>

<p><i>Second Inquisitor.</i> Small worth.</p>

<p><i>First Monk.</i><span style="margin-left: 6em;">My song&mdash;</span></p>

<p><i>First Inquisitor.</i> I had a sister like her once my friend.</p>

<p class='noindent'>Where is our brother Peter? When you're nigh,<br />
He is not far. I'd have him speak for her.<br />
I saw his jovial mood bring once a smile<br />
To sainted Ebremar's sad eyes. I think<br />
He loves our brother Peter in his heart.<br />
If Peter would but ask her life&mdash;who knows?</p>

<p><i>First Monk.</i> He digs his cabbages. He brings to mind<br />

<i>First Inquisitor.</i> Be still, I hear the step of Ebremar.<br />
Yonder he comes; bright-eyed, and hollow-cheeked<br />
From fasting&mdash;see, the red light slanting down<br />
From the great painted window wraps his brow,<br />
As with an aureole.</p>

<p class='center'>[<i>Ebremar enters&mdash;they all bow to him.</i>]</p>

<p><i>First Inquisitor.</i> My suit to you&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Ebremar.</i> I will not hear; the Moorish girl must die.<br />
I will burn heresy from this mad earth,<br />
And&mdash;</p>

<p><i>First Inquisitor.</i> Mercy is the manna of the world.</p>

<p><i>Ebremar.</i> The wages of sin is death.</p>

<p><i>Second Monk.</i><span style="margin-left: 10em;">No use.</span></p>

<p><i>First Inquisitor.</i> My lord, if it must be, I pray descend<br />
Yourself into the dungeon 'neath our feet<br />
And importune with weighty words this Moor,<br />
That she foreswear her heresies and save<br />
Her soul from seas of endless flame in hell.</p>

<p><i>Ebremar.</i> I speak alone with servants of the Cross<br />
And dying men&mdash;and yet&mdash;but no, farewell.</p>

<p><i>Second Monk.</i> No use.</p>

<p><i>Ebremar.</i> Away! [<i>They go.</i>] Hear oh! thou enduring God,<br />
Who giveth to the golden-crested wren<br />
Her hanging mansion. Give to me, I pray,<br />
The burthen of thy truth. Reach down thy hands<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>And fill me with thy rage, that I may bruise<br />
The heathen. Yea, and shake the sullen kings<br />
Upon their thrones. The lives of men shall flow<br />
As quiet as the little rivulets<br />
Beneath the sheltering shadow of thy Church,<br />
And thou shalt bend, enduring God, the knees<br />
Of the great warriors whose names have sung<br />
The world to its fierce infancy again.<br />
</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Scene III.</span></h3>

<p class='center'><i>The dungeon of the Inquisition. The morning of the Auto-da-Fe<br />
dawns dimly through a barred window. A few faint stars<br />
are shining. Swallows are circling in the dimness without.</i></p>

<p><i>Mosada.</i> Oh! swallows, swallows, swallows, will ye fly<br />
This eve, to-morrow, or to-morrow night<br />
Above the farm-house by the little lake<br />
That's rustling in the reeds with patient pushes,<br />
Soft as a long dead footstep whispering through<br />
The brain. My brothers will be passing down<br />
Quite soon the cornfield, where the poppies grow,<br />
To their farm-work; how silent all will be.<br />
But no, in this warm weather, 'mong the hills,<br />
Will be the faint far thunder-sound as though<br />
The world were dreaming in its summer sleep;<br />
That will be later, day is scarcely dawning.<br />
And Hassan will be with them&mdash;he was so small,<br />
A weak, thin child, when last I saw him there.<br />
He will be taller now&mdash;'twas long ago.<br />
<br />
The men are busy in the glimmering square.<br />
I hear the murmur as they raise the beams<br />
To build the circling seats, where high in air<br />
Soon will the churchmen nod above the crowd.<br />
I'm not of that pale company whose feet<br />
Ere long shall falter through the noisy square,<br />
And not come thence&mdash;for here in this small ring,<br />
Hearken, ye swallows! I have hoarded up<br />
A poison drop. The toy of fancy once,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>A fashion with us Moorish maids, begot<br />
Of dreaming and of watching by the door<br />
The shadows pass; but now, I love my ring,<br />
For it alone of all the world will do<br />
My bidding.</p>

<p class='center'>[<i>Sucks poison from the ring.</i>]</p>

<p><span style="margin-left: 6em;">Now 'tis done, and I am glad</span><br />
And free&mdash;'twill thieve away with sleepy mood<br />
My thoughts, and yonder brightening patch of sky<br />
With three bars crossed, and these four walls my world,<br />
And yon few stars, grown dim like eyes of lovers<br />
The noisy world divides. How soon a deed<br />
So small makes one grow weak and tottering.<br />
Where shall I lay me down? That question is<br />
A weighty question, for it is the last.<br />
Not there, for there a spider weaves her web.<br />
Nay here, I'll lay me down where I can watch<br />
The burghers of the night fade one by one,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 10em;">... Yonder a leaf</span><br />
Of apple blossom circles in the gloom,<br />
Floating from yon barred window. New comer,<br />
Thou'rt welcome. Lie there close against my fingers.<br />
I wonder which is whitest, they or thou.<br />
'Tis thou, for they've grown blue around the nails.<br />
My blossom, I am dying, and the stars<br />
Are dying too. They were full seven stars;<br />
Two only now they are, two side by side.<br />
Oh! Allah, it was thus they shone that night,<br />
When my lost lover left these arms. My Vallence,<br />
We meet at last, the ministering stars<br />
Of our nativity hang side by side,<br />
And throb within the circles of green dawn.<br />
Too late, too late, for I am near to death.<br />
I try to lift mine arms&mdash;they fall again.<br />
This death is heavy in my veins like sleep.<br />
I cannot even crawl along the flags<br />
A little nearer those bright stars. Tell me,<br />
Is it your message, stars, that when death comes<br />
My soul shall touch with his, and the two flames<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>Be one? I think all's finished now and sealed.</p>

<p class='center'>[<i>After a pause enter Ebremar.</i>]</p>

<p><i>Ebremar.</i> Young Moorish girl, thy final hour is here,<br />
Cast off thy heresies and save thy soul<br />
From dateless pain. She sleeps&mdash;</p>

<p class='center'>[<i>Starting.</i>]</p>

<p><span style="margin-left: 10em;">Mosada&mdash;thou&mdash;</span><br />
Oh God!&mdash;awake, thou shalt not die. She sleeps.<br />
Her head cast backward in her unloosed hair.<br />
Look up, look up, thy Vallence is by thee.<br />
A fearful paleness creeps across her breast<br />
And out-spread arms.</p>

<p class='center'>[<i>Casting himself down by her.</i>]</p>

<p><span style="margin-left: 10em;">Be not so pale, dear love.</span><br />
Oh! can my kisses bring a flush no more<br />
Upon thy face. How heavily thy head<br />
Hangs on my breast. Listen, we shall be safe.<br />
We'll fly from this before the morning star.<br />
Dear heart, there is a secret way that leads<br />
Its paven length towards the river's marge,<br />
Where lies a shallop in the yellow reeds.<br />
Awake, awake, and we will sail afar,<br />
Afar along the fleet white river's face&mdash;<br />
Alone with our own whispers and replies&mdash;<br />
Alone among the murmurs of the dawn.<br />
Among thy nation none shall know that I<br />
Was Ebremar, whose thoughts were fixed on God,<br />
And heaven, and holiness.</p>

<p><i>Mosada.</i><span style="margin-left: 6em;">Let's talk and grieve,</span><br />
For that's the sweetest music for sad souls.<br />
Day's dead, all flame-bewildered, and the hills<br />
In list'ning silence gazing on our grief.<br />
I never knew an eve so marvellous still.</p>

<p><i>Ebremar.</i> Her dreams are talking with old years. Awake,<br />
Grieve not, for Vallence kneels beside thee&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Mosada.</i><span style="margin-left: 12em;">Vallence,</span><br />

I never knew a night so dew-bedrowned.</p>

<p><i>Ebremar.</i> Oh! hush the wandering music of thy mind.<br />
Look on me once. Why sink your eyelids so?<br />

Poor love and sorrow with their arms thrown round<br />

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
